    "Text Preprocessing: Stopwords with NLTK\n",
    "Text Preprocessing is a crucial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves transforming raw text into a format that can be effectively used by machine learning models. One important task in text preprocessing is the removal of stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Are Stopwords?\n",
    "Stopwords are commonly used words in a language that carry very little information. These words are usually filtered out from text data because they don't contribute much to the analysis. Examples of stopwords in English include words like \"the\", \"is\", \"in\", \"and\", etc. Removing stopwords helps reduce noise and focuses the analysis on the more meaningful words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of NLP, removing stopwords can help:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduce dimensionality of the text data.\n",
    "Improve model performance by removing less informative words.\n",
    "Speed up computation by focusing only on important words."
